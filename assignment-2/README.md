# Exercise 3: Deploy and secure an API
## Objectives
In this exercise, you deploy and secure an API implementation. You will:
•       Deploy a Mule API application to CloudHub.
•       Create simple test flows to automatically set sample required headers and parameters before calling an API endpoint. 
•       Create an API proxy for a Mule application and apply an SLA based rate limiting policy.

# Exercise 4: Use an API implementation as its own proxy
## Objectives
In this exercise, you configure a Mule application that has already deployed to CloudHub to manage its own API proxies. You will:
•       Configure a Mule application to enable autodiscovery for API Manager.
•       Redeploy the Mule application to CloudHub.
•       Test that the implementation URL is now enforcing API policies set in API Manager.
