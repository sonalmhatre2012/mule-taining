# Exercise 1: Create an API specification with RAML
## Objectives
In this exercise, you create an API specification using RAML. You will:
•       Appropriately specify GET and POST methods.
•       Appropriately define URI parameters, query parameters, and headers.
•       Restrict possible values using an enumeration.
## Scenario
Your company needs to expose a customer accounts database as a System API for the rest of the organization. The first step is to create the RAML specification and post it to your company’s private Anypoint Exchange so all stakeholders can review and provide feedback. This RAML specification needs to separate out data type definitions from the main API RAML file into separate reusable RAML files.

# Exercise 2: Implement a REST API using APIkit
Objectives
In this exercise, you implement a REST API that has a RAML specification. You will:
•       Use APIkit to create implementation flows.
•       Add logic to APIkit auto-generated flows.
•       Enhance an API and regenerate the flows using APIkit.
